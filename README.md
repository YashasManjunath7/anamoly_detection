# Anomaly Detection Using Autoencoder

## Key Components

### 1. Libraries Used:
- `pandas`: For reading and manipulating the dataset.
- `tensorflow` and `keras`: To build the autoencoder model using dense layers.
- `sklearn.metrics`: To evaluate the model using precision, recall, and F1 score.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting and visualizing data and results.

### 2. Data:
- The dataset used in this notebook comes from the [NAB (Numenta Anomaly Benchmark)](https://github.com/numenta/NAB) repository.
- The specific dataset is the "ambient_temperature_system_failure" CSV file, which tracks temperature data.

### 3. Model:
- **Autoencoder**: The notebook uses an autoencoder model, which is a type of neural network that attempts to learn a compressed representation of data (encoding) and then reconstruct it (decoding).
- If the reconstruction error (difference between input and output) is larger than a set threshold, the data point is flagged as an anomaly.

### 4. Process:
- **Step 1**: Import necessary libraries.
- **Step 2**: Load the dataset.
- **Step 3**: Preprocess the dataset by excluding unnecessary columns and normalizing values.
- **Step 4**: Build the autoencoder model using Keras' functional API.
- **Step 5**: Train the model on normal data (non-anomalous data).
- **Step 6**: Use the model to predict and calculate reconstruction error.
- **Step 7**: Evaluate the results using precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Step 8**: Visualize the reconstruction loss and identify anomalies.

### 5. Evaluation Metrics:
- Precision, recall, and F1 score are used to measure the effectiveness of anomaly detection. These metrics are calculated based on the reconstruction error.

### 6. Visualization:
- The notebook plots the reconstruction loss for both normal and anomalous data points.
- A threshold is set to distinguish between normal and anomalous points based on the reconstruction error.

## Conclusion:
This notebook provides a simple yet effective demonstration of using an autoencoder for anomaly detection. By training the autoencoder on normal data and calculating reconstruction loss, anomalies can be detected when the model fails to accurately reconstruct the data.
